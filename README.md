# Goal/Purpose
The goal/purpose of this Black History Month project is to inspire black people by creating tribute pages, of modern black professionals in tech and/or business, that contain links to resources/programs for black people to get into tech and/or business.

# How do you decide who to make tribute pages of?

## Criteria 1: Modernity
Is this person born during our times, or are they from a long time ago with black-and-white photos?

Unlike tribute pages that show historical figures, this tribute page showcases successful black people from today's times. This is a lot more relatable and inspiring, and it conveys that black people succeed today (not just back then).

## Criteria 2: Resources/Programs
Is this person in any way related to some resource/program for black people? Did they use a resource/program to spring into their success? Did they create a resource/program for black people? Do they recommend resources/programs?

Unlike tribute pages that merely portray a biography, this tribute page helps black people take action to pursue success by increasing access to resources/programs and hyperlinking useful resources/programs.
